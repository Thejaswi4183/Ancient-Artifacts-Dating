# Artifact Dating

Artifact Dating is a project designed to estimate the age of various historical artifacts, including coins, sculptures, and inscriptions. This repository contains code and resources to help analyze and date artifacts based on features extracted from images and metadata.

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning and image processing techniques to automatically classify and date artifacts. It includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to use the model and analyze artifacts.
- Datasets containing images of coins, sculptures, and inscriptions, along with metadata (e.g., historical context, origin).
- Preprocessing scripts to prepare the data for model training.
- Nextjs app for the frontend

The goal is to develop a tool that can help historians, archaeologists, and researchers by automating the dating process, improving accuracy and efficiency.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:
- **Images**: High-quality images of coins, sculptures, and inscriptions.(Sadly due to the size of the images, Dataset/artifact_dataset/images is not uploaded here
- **CSV File**: Contains metadata such as artifact type, origin, historical context, and known dates.


## FrontEnd

Nextjs
